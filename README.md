# FBI NICS Firearm Background

The analysis in this repository focuses on firearm acquisition trends. The study aims to understand patterns in firearm checks and their distribution over time. 

> This descriptive analysis showes the number of firearm background checks innitiated through the NICS. NOTE: The number of firearm background checks initiated through the NICS do not represent the number of firearms sold. Based on varying state laws and purchase scenarios.

# Motivation 

Understanding firearm background checks across the U.S. is crucial for policymakers, researchers, and the general public. We can transform raw data into insightful geographic representations, which helps to identify trends, regional disparities, and the impact of policy changes on firearm sales.
